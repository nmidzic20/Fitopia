A web application created within 24 hours for RiHack 2023 hackathon, aimed at promoting health using gamification. The idea is for users to be able to unlock new chapters of a visual novel via walking a certain amount of km each day, which would be tracked via Google Fit app with smartwatches or smartphones. The map of the game world is original, the chapter artwork is created using AI assets.
